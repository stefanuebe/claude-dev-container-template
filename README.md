Simple setup to use Claude Code on your local machine in a devcontainer. 

Inspired by Claude Code's original devcontainer setup. Most important change is, that the firewall is not active and claude has priviliged rights inside the container.

The __.bashrc contains shortcuts to build, start, stop and access the devcontainer in the shell.
